S32K14x_AMMCLIB_1.1.21
=======================
Revision 1.1.21
30-June-2020

RELEASE NOTES
=============
This is the NXP Service Release for rev 1.1.21 of the Automotive Math and Motor Control Library Set for NXP S32K14x devices, supporting the ARM M4 core based devices.

Installation instructions:
==========================
Run S32K14x_AMMCLIB_RTM_1_1_21.exe self executable file, in order to start the installation procedure and follow the instruction on the screen. The recommended destination path (the default one) is: C:\NXP\AMMCLIB\S32K14x_AMMCLIB_1.1.21

Important notes:
================
As the Automotive Math and Motor Control Library Set for NXP S32K14x devices supports the global configuration option, it is highly recommended to copy the SWLIBS_Config.h file to your local structure and refer the configuration to this local copy. This approach will prevent the incorrect setup of default configuration option, in case multiple projects with different default configuration are used.

The Automotive Math and Motor Control Library Set for NXP S32K14x devices is delivered without pre-selected default configuration option in the SWLIBS_Config.h file. The user is responsible to set the default configuration option according the application need, otherwise the error message is displayed and the compilation of the user application did not succeed.

To get correct results from macros FRAC32(x) and FRAC16(x), the compiler must support double precision floating-point constants. Make sure to set the compiler options according to the chapter "Pre-compiled library compilation options".

The bit-accurate models contain sources auto-generated by MATLAB(r). (c) 1984 - 2014 The MathWorks, Inc.
