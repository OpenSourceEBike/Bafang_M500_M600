@brief Low Power Timer Peripheral Driver
<p>
The LPTMR is a configurable general-purpose 16-bit counter that has two
operational modes: Timer and Pulse-Counter.

Depending on the configured operational mode, the counter in the LPTMR can
be incremented using a clock input (Timer mode) or an event counter (external
events like button presses or internal events from different trigger sources).

## Timer Mode ##
In Timer mode, the LPTMR increments the internal counter from a selectable
clock source. An optional 16-bit prescaler can be configured.

## Pulse-Counter Mode ##
In Pulse-Counter Mode, the LPTMR counter increments from a selectable
trigger source, input pin, which can be an external event (like a button
press) or internal events (like triggers from TRGMUX).

An optional 16-bit glitch-filter can be configured to reject events that have
a duration below a set period.

## Initialization prerequisites ##
Before configuring the LPTMR, the peripheral clock must be enabled
from the PCC module.

The peripheral clock must not be confused with the counter clock, which is selectable
within the LPTMR.

## Driver configuration ##
The LPTMR driver allows configuring the LPTMR for Pulse-Counter Mode or Timer Mode
via the general configuration structure.

Configurable options:
    - work mode (timer or pulse-counter)
    - enable interrupts and DMA requests
    - free running mode (overflow mode of the counter)
    - compare value (interrupt generation on counter value)
    - compare value measurement units (counter ticks or microseconds)
    - input clock selection
    - prescaler/glitch filter configuration
    - enable bypass prescaler
    - pin select (for pulse-counter mode)
    - input pin and polarity (for pulse-counter mode)

## API ##
Some of the features exposed by the API are targeted specifically for Timer Mode or
Pulse-Counter Mode. For example, configuring the Compare Value in microseconds makes sense
only for Timer Mode, so therefor it is restricted for use in Pulse-Counter mode.

For any invalid configuration the functions will either return an error code or trigger DEV_ASSERT (if enabled).
For more details, please refer to each function description.
